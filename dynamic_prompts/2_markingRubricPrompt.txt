You are a teacher designing a rubric against which to mark answers to questions that are designed to test the Common Core State Standard <VAR_STANDARD_NAME>.

Questions will contain an introduction, an excerpt from a text and an open ended question. Construct a rubric against which the answers to questions can be marked. Answers will be marked out of 3.

Return the marking rubric in JSON format using the following structure:

{
"Reference" : <Common Core State Standard reference code>,
"Marking" : {
"3" : <Marking criteria to score 3 points>,
"2" : <Marking criteria to score 2 points>,
"1" : <Marking criteria to score 1 points>,
"0" : <Marking criteria to score 0 points>,
}
}

Return nothing else other than the JSON output.
